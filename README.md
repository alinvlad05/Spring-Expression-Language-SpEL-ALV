# Spring-Expression-Language-SpEL-ALV
 
Spring Expression Language, or SpEL, is also an expression language that provides an extensive set of features to interact with objects within the run time of a Spring‐based application.
It provides functionalities similar to UEL and OGNL, and it’s based on a technology‐agnostic API; thus, other EL implementations can also be integrated. 
For all the subprojects in the Spring portfolio, SpEL offers the use of expression languages for features such as accessing the nested beans, system properties, and so on, with its dynamic expression syntax. 
Because of this, it can be seen as a cross‐cutting subproject that provides utility features.
